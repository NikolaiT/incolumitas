## A scraping service for scientists, marketing professionals, analysts or SEO folk

In autumn 2018, I created a scraping service called **[scrapeulous.com](https://scrapeulous.com/)**.

There you can purchase scrape jobs that allow you to upload a keyword file which in turn is scraped using Google or other search engines. Various different regions can be chosen as scraping origin. Payment is possible with Paypal or Stripe. Alternatively, you can use the API. This allows you to integrate live SERP search results into your own product. 

Common scenarios why people use this service:

1. Comparing advertisement keywords in your niche
2. Market intelligence research 
3. Many other scenarios

You will receive the scraping results as either json or csv files. If you use the API, you will receive results immediately.

By using this service, you are able to quickly scrape thousands of keywords and make use of the SERP data to analyze trends and make important business decisions.
