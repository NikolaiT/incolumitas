*Important:* I am a computer scientist, not a economist or sociologist. So please take everything written here with a grain of salt - as always. Some of the information is based on educated guesses, other statements are wild guesses. I am sharing my thoughts about society and economy because I assume that some of my readers might find it interesting how I think.

## Introduction

While I am writing this blog post, I look out of an airplane window. Right after the plane took off, I saw many spots of rotten trees inside the forest close to the airport of Cologne/Bonn. Then a couple of minutes later, while the plane is cruising around 10.000 metres above the ground, it's impossible for me to see a place where humans have not left their mark, where nature has been left untouched.

Rivers are straightened, forests are cut down, huge cities are everywhere and there does not exist a single spot without a human intervention. Granted, I am flying above Western Europe and the sight might be completely different over the vast wilderness of Sibiria  (Namely, I'd see endless [forest fires](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/49171/russia-record-breaking-fires-siberia/)).

The point I try to make is that human progress and the advance of societies on this earth pose a huge amount of stress on the natural environment. 

Resources such as living space, food, water and energy is scarce, meanwhile the human population is growing. Of course, the growth rate has decreased and projections assume the human population to be ceiling at the end of the 21st century at around [10.9 billion people](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/17/worlds-population-is-projected-to-nearly-stop-growing-by-the-end-of-the-century/). Nevertheless, the human greed to own more and more material goods is not going to stop anytime soon.

In this blog post, I try to sketch what problems the earth has to overcome in the next 30, 50 and 100 years. While I am fully aware that it is notoriously difficult to make long term projections, I try to give it a go here.

In order to have some structure, I try to divide my essay into the following sections:

1. Climate Crisis
2. Globalisation & Economy
3. Geopolitics & War
4. Advance of Medicine & Technology


## Climate Crisis

It's relatively easy to proof that there is more CO2 in the atmosphere due to human influence. CO2 atoms that originate from fossil fuels (and thus the ground) do not have any radioactive decay (more exact: [CO2 is depleted in natural radioactive Carbon-14](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/climate-change-evidence-causes/basics-of-climate-change/)), because the half-life is with 5,730 ± 40 years relatively low. At the same time, an increasing rate of CO2 molecule samples that we can collect in the atmosphere show no such half-life, thus proving that they must originate from fossil fuels.

The question whether this increase of CO2 atom does also cause the climate crisis, is harder to answer. But even if the climate change theory is just a theory and it remains hard to prove that the climate crisis is fully man-made, it's an undeniable fact that the earth is heating up at an alarming pace.

</figure>

This increase in temperature causes a myriad of primary problems:

1. Heat Waves and the suffering of humans under heat domes and subsequent wild fires. 
2. The melting of glaciers and the ice on the north pole and Antarctic.
3. Huge wildfires in Russia/Siberia which in turn increase the emission of CO2
4. Other extreme weather events such as floods, hurricanes, storms, ...
5. The increase of the sea level and the endangerment of countries whose territories are close to the sea level

The past has shown that many countries on the planet have very little means to protect their population from climate disasters. Most recently, tropical storms and earthquakes (Earthquakes are no consequence of climate-change) in Haiti caused [many thousand climate refugees](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/sep/18/haiti-migrants-us-texas-violence) that are headed to the US border, even though the US under the Biden administration is reluctant to allow any refugee to enter the country.

Projections show that we have to expect millions of climate refugees from the southern hemisphere pushing into northern countries. On Sept. 13, 2021, the [updated Groundswell report from the Worldbank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/09/13/climate-change-could-force-216-million-people-to-migrate-within-their-own-countries-by-2050) predicts that up to 216 million people across six world regions are forced to move due to climate change within their countries. The report states that *By 2050, Sub-Saharan Africa could see as many as 86 million internal climate migrants; East Asia and the Pacific, 49 million; South Asia, 40 million; North Africa, 19 million; Latin America, 17 million; and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, 5 million.* 

As a German, I can say that the Syrian Civil war (albeit not caused by climate change) and migration streams caused by socio-economic or military conflicts that caused [1.5 million](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_L%C3%A4nder_nach_gefl%C3%BCchteter_Bev%C3%B6lkerung#L%C3%A4nder_nach_Bestand_an_internationalen_Fl%C3%BCchtlingen) refugees in Germany almost tore the German society apart. As a result, the far right political party AFD emerged and to this day has widespread support in the society. (12.5% and 10% of all Germans voted for them in 2017 and 2021). It's relatively safe to say that Germany will not overcome another major refugee movement (major = More than 2 million refugees) without civil-war-like violent outbursts.

The same applies to many other *rich* European countries. Most European societies are very fragile and the relatively high prosperity is standing on thin legs. We can already see a fortification of the European coastlines and refugee streams are already used politically by countries such as Turkey (To be fair, Turkey took with [4 million refugees](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_L%C3%A4nder_nach_gefl%C3%BCchteter_Bev%C3%B6lkerung#L%C3%A4nder_nach_Bestand_an_internationalen_Fl%C3%BCchtlingen) the majority of Syrian migrants and the political pressure against Europe is somewhat understandable in this context).
  
The question begs to be answered: If the collapse of a relatively small nation such as Syria causes so much trouble in the refugee-absorbing nations such as Turkey and Germany, what will happen if entire geographical regions become gradually more inhabitable? Of course this will be a slow and continuous process over the next 50 years, but we can already observe it in certain parts of the world:

1. The recent heat wave in Summer 2021 and in 2020 on the North American West-Coast and the lack of water supply motivated already quite some people to pack up and leave elsewhere (Montana for example). The New York Times [wrote about this anticipated refugee waves in the US](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/15/magazine/climate-crisis-migration-america.html) last year and predicts *that 13 million Americans will be forced to move away from submerged coastlines. Add to that the people contending with wildfires and other risks, and the number of Americans who might move — though difficult to predict precisely — could easily be tens of millions larger.* 

2. In the Sahel zone, the [rainy seasons are growing shorter and the dry seasons are longer](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2020/09/21/where-climate-change-is-reality-supporting-africas-sahel-pastoralists-secure-a-resilient-future). In 2010, a draught was particularly arduous. It is estimated to have killed more than 4.8 million head of cattle In Niger, roughly 25% of the herd.

It has to be mentioned that it's scientifically not accurate to claim that people flee only because of climate change reasons. It's often a complicated mix of socio-economic reasons. Natural disasters might be only the icing of the cake. For example, the natural environment of the Gulf nations might be an impossible living environment for a poor civilisation that depends on agriculture and low-level manufacturing. But it poses no risk to the extremely rich Gulf nations that only export oil and oil products and import everything else. But still, it's utter [madness to create cities such as Dubai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJuqe6sre2I) in inhospitable regions.


## Globalisation & Economy

We are close to the year 2022 and it's safe to say that our world is thoroughly globalized. Maybe the Covid19 pandemic reduced the acceleration of the Globalisation, but in the big picture, you can barely see the Covid19 pandemic dent in the trend.

I think it's fair to say that it doesn't really matter where your live on this planet if you earn enough money (maybe with an income > 50.000 EUR). You surely to exclude both tails of the countries - the poorest and richest - because that amount of money will get you nowhere in New York and you most likely don't want to live in Somalia either. But everywhere else, in totally average countries such as Bulgaria, Malaysia, Argentina or Germany, you will be doing great with that income.

You can have a decent live in a gated community in the Democratic Repulic of Congo when you earn 50k EUR/year and you can have a shitty life in Germany if you earn 20k EUR/year. Of course, Germany might safe you from starvation and being homeless and the DRC won't (I am guessing), but my general point still stands: It mostly doesn't matter where you live on this planet, it only matters how much money you make.

So how does the future economy and work force look like?

I am convinced that inequality will become even greater in the future. If you come from nothing, It's extremely hard to find a good and high-income job that allows you to build basic wealth. And by basic wealth I mean a decent house and a decent car and the ability to support your family. On the other hand, if you are already wealthy, it's hard to become poor again. 

Working will not make you rich. Working prevents you from immediate death by starvation, but not anything else. If you want to become wealthy in the 21st century, you have to do one of the following:

1. Be already wealthy
2. Inherit wealth
3. Be extremely smart/talented AND lucky and become rich by yourself with startup ideas, art, sports, fashion, ...

If you own real estate and stocks, your assets have more than doubled in the past couple of years. For Millenials such as me, even though I have a relatively good job, it's utterly impossible to buy a normal house. A normal house costs 700.000 EUR where I live (Cologne / Germany). Those exact houses did cost 200.000 EUR 10 years ago. How are you supposed to compete with those rising prices? All you can do as a person in that situation, is to hope for an economic crash like in 2009.

For example, I am currently 30 years old and if I want to buy this normal house for 700.000 EUR, I will need to work for 60 years as of now. I will have cleared my debt at the ripe age of 90 years old. And that's not going to happen :D

Sure, some people did risk it and bought those houses with a little down-payment and a huge mortgage and ended up with a houses that doubled in price in 4 years, but for me, it does not make sense to get massively into debt for a house that did cost a third of it years ago. Of course, the interest rates are extremely low right now and the inflation relatively high, so future debt is worth much less. But I am still hesitant. 

I mean just have a look on the house price index in Germany:

<figure>
    <img src="{static}/images/germany-housing-index.png" alt="housePrice" />
    <figcaption>Housing Prices <span style="font-size: 60%">(Source: https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/housing-index)</span></figcaption>
</figure>

Does this look normal to you? The prices are increasing more and more.

But there is a general trend in the world: 

Everything that has tangible value, such as real estate and stocks, increase in price. There is a massive fight for resources. Nobody wants to save money, because inflation burns money in an alarming pace.

## Geopolitics & War

Probably the most remarkable event in the past month was the chaotic retreat of the Western World from Afghanistan. NATO forces were 20 years in this extremely poor country and spend billions of Dollars to arm the Afghan army for nothing. The Afghan army succumbed in a matter of days to the Taliban. 

I am not so interested in the specific case of Afghanistan, I want to discuss what can be concluded by this milestone event.

US and NATO interventions are a thing of the past. The US won the cold war and itervened with boots on the ground in many countries during that time (Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, ...), but the war in Afghanistan was probably the last such extensive operation. The US will still defend it's allies such as Taiwan, but pro-active wars like that in Afghanistan are very unlikely to happen in the next 10 years.

China did not even try to hide that their were talking with the Taliban days after the US retreat. China will take over business in extremely many countries that were depended on the western world until most recently. The western world was not only feared because their military capabilities, but mostly because of the necessity to cooperate economically with the EU & North America. China poses an alternative to that. The promise that China is giving to countries such as Iran, Afghanistan or many African countries is the following:

China does not care about your political issues and how you rule your country. We respect your internal affairs. All that we want is to create a win-win situation by trading with you and investing in your nation. China want's to interact economically, they don't have an interest to export their ideology.

## Advance of Medicine & Technology

I am a computer scientist and thus my viewpoint might be skewed, buy I don't really think that we will see major technological leaps in the next 10 - 20 years. With major technological leaps I mean things such as:

Technological Breakthroughs

1. General Artificial Intelligence and Singularity as a result
2. Fusion reactors that are economical and don't produce radioactive waste
3. Quantum computers that can reduce the time complexity for real world algorithmic problems such as integer factorization used in the asymmetric cryptosystem RSA (Shor's algorithm). Another application is unstructured search where the task is to find a marked item out of a list of `n` items in a database (Grover's algorithm).

Medical discoveries / breakthroughs

1. Vastly reducing or entirely stopping the natural aging process
2. Curing chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes (of which the prior discovery is a superset)
3. Curing and reversing neurological damage after incidents such as strokes, accidents or traumata to the head

Sure, there are some cool things that are happening and will most likely happen in the soon future such as 

1. Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C are almost [completely curable](https://www.medicinenet.com/can_hep_c_be_cured_completely/article.htm). We developed anti retroviral medication that can eradicate Hepatitis C: *The "direct-acting" antiviral medications are given over 12 weeks. These are combination medications and will cure early acute hepatitis C in more than 90 percent of people. They are Harvoni (combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir) and Viekira Pak (a mix of ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir)*

2. HIV might become curable in the next 10 years. Biontech and Moderna launched several [phase 1 trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05001373) for mRNA vaccines against HIV. But it has to be said that phase 1 vaccination trials only means: *Phase 1, Randomized, First-in-human, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of eOD-GT8 60mer mRNA Vaccine (mRNA-1644) and Core-g28v2 60mer mRNA Vaccine (mRNA-1644v2-Core) in HIV-1 Uninfected Adults in Good General Health.* Put differently: They first want to see if the vaccine doesn't harm HIV **uninfected** individuals and generates the desired immune response, before they look if the vaccine effectively prevents HIV infection in the future.

3. mRNA vaccines against Cancer. For example, stage 3 and stage 4 Melanoma, a highly lethal skin cancer in very late stages had a [survival rate of 6 to 7 months in the year 2000](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01038-9). Nowadays, in the year 2021, with the the help of immunotherapy and targeted therapy such as checkpoint inhibitors, the same late stage malicious cancer has a 5-year survival rate between [22.5% (stage 3) - 63% (stage 4)](https://www.curemelanoma.org/about-melanoma/melanoma-staging/melanoma-survival-rates/). That is a fucking huge leap in a quick time :)
