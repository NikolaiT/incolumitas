### First post in the new year!

Hey

Happy new year to all of you and let 2015 be a succesful year for us
all!

My **New Year's resolution** is to write at least two blog posts every
month and try to get my scraping service on
[scrapeulous.com](http://scrapeulous.com "my scraping service") up and
running!

### Good program to record the desktop/audio on linux

But what I really wanted to share today is an awesome way to record your
desktop with audio on Linux. I tried my luck several times with VLC, but
it's a freaking pain in the ass to use. Furthermore, VLC will probably
never be able to capture the desktop with audio (See [this stackoverflow
thread](http://superuser.com/questions/612186/how-to-capture-screen-video-with-audio-using-vlc-media-player)
for more info).

But I just found an wonderful alternative (one could almost assume that
I am advertisting, which is not the case, I swear!):

<http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/recordMyDesktop>

If you want to visit the home page of the program, [click
here](http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php). Although the
home page is very ugly and the program is not longer in active
development, it just works like a charm. On Ubuntu you may install it
like this:

`sudo apt-get install recordmydesktop`

Then go to a directory very you want to save the output file and just
enter `recordmydesktop` in a shell.

The program begins to record. When hitting Control-C, the capture stops
and the file is written (Which takes a bit time). Then you can play your
capture (With VLC for example).

### Conclusion

This shows me once more what the most integral parts in the art of
software development really are:

-   The most common usage case of the program should be it's default
    behaviour!
-   Usability is the most important part of any software. Users are
    frustrated very easily.
-   The program must be robust. If it doesn't work, potential customers
    are drained away to the concurrence!

All these points apply on recordmydesktop, which makes it very nice to
work with!

Hope you got something out of this.
