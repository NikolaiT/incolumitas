Hey folks!

Had some difficulties understanding UNIX file permissions in all it's
variations and eternal predisposition to misuse as adminman! Made a
little PDF, the independent blog article will follow soon. It's just a
pain in the ass to format all that LibreOffice into a nice wordpress
format. Next time, I will just do it in plain ASCII 7 Bit style,
goddamnit...

Hell, it's time to read some phrack stuff again :)
